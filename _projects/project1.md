# Star Sweepers

- **Developed:** 2023
- **Genre:** Some sort of chill movement

### Overview
Star Sweepers is a movement based game about dodging obstacles and solving objectives around a map. In the game you play as a janitor who sweeps up broken stars in the sky; putting them back together. All while dodging asteroids and aiming for the best time to claim that gold medal.

### What I Did
I was in charge of the majority of gameplay tasks within the project Most notably; the player movement which I am quite happy with.

The movement required constant work during development, changing every week to reflect player feedback to make sure that it was as good as possible since it was the main draw of the game.

The game features two obstacles, both in forms of asteroids that crash down on you while you play. One of these I made.

This asteroid comes crashing down from an angle and then rolls once it hits the ground. Bouncing of walls and being a general menace.

During development, we used the plugin DoTween which made it easy to animate things through code. For example, the asteroid bounce shown in previous gif was made by tweening. but also this level intro that plays at the start of a level to show where the pieces of the star are located on the map.
